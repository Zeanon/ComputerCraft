# DraconicReactorGenerationOverview
## Setup
just connect the reactors via peripheral proxys and the internalOutput fluxgates to the computer and add a screen
<br>make sure, that there are no other monitors belonging to another computer connected to the same network or the autodetection of the different items will not work properly
<br>the items displayed on the screen will adjust depending on the height of the screen
<br>if you add another screen or reactor, just reboot the system to make the computer detect it

<br>you can also edit whether a screen uses smallFont or whether it shows the scroll buttons
